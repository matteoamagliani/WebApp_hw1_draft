There are 5 custom enumerations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item userRole: contains a value for each possible role of the users.
    \item orderStatus: contains a value for each possible order state.
    \item tagsCathegory: contains a value for each possible cathegory of tag.
    \item allTags: contains a value for each name of an available tag.
    \item imageExtension: contains a value for each accepted image extensions.
\end{itemize}
The subdivision of client profiles into generic users and business users is used to give the latter more powerful querying
functionalities in order to search artists using advanced filters (follower count, tags, number of published art pieces, ecc.).\\
The subdivision of artistic profiles between artist and art galleries is used to manage upload operations. Only artistic 
profiles with role "artist" can participate to an \textit{Upload} or a \textit{Participates} relationship, while only artistic profiles with role
"art gallery" can participate to an \textit{Organize} relationship. Also an artistic profile cannot follow itself.\\
A tag can only participate to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Has 1} relationship if it has cathegory attribute "artpiece"
    \item \textit{Has 2} relationship if it has cathegory attribute "event"
    \item \textit{Has 3} relationship if it has cathegory attribute equal to the role attribute of the artisti profile
\end{itemize}
A location must participate to either a \textit{In} or a \textit{Shipment} relationship (or both).\\
