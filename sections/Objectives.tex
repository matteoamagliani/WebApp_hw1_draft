The objective of the project, in continuation with the one developed during the database course,
is to develop a platform where artists and art galleries can share their work and organized events
to the general public and to companies. The project main focus is to allow the reviewing and selling
of art pieces, to allow art galleries to showcase their events and to allow companies to search for 
artists to work with.
